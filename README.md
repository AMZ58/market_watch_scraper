# market_watch_scraper

This webscraper crawls marketwatch.com by ticker and iterates over the financial statements. It then downloads the statements and relevant data and organizes the data under new directorys by the industry you selected to analyze. All tickers fed into the webscraper are selected by the highest market cap of their industry. 

For this code to work for you, you will need to edit the path to where you wish to store the data and read the ticker list from. It is currently configured to paths on my OS. I will configure an option in the future for users to enter a path to store their data.
